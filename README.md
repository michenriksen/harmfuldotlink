# Should I click this link?

A simple click-through decision flowchart to help people decide wether they
should click a link or not. **This thing should not be taken too seriously!**

The excellent flowchart is taken from [Intel ClickSmart](http://digitalsecurity.intel.com/clicksmart/en/#flowchart). Hope they won't mind. :)
